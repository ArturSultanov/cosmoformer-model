# Cosmoformer Model

## Introduction

This repository "Cosmoformer Model" contains pipeline for training and saving `CosmoFormer` model, that was based on `CrossFormer` architecture. Both model and pipeline are the parts of my Bachelor thesis at Brno Technical University (BUT).

## Model overview

`CrossFormer` architecure has been used for model creation. The model code has been obtained via `vit-pytorch` Python package.

```python
model = CrossFormer(
    num_classes=len(le.classes_),
    dim=(32, 64, 128, 256),
    depth=(2, 2, 4, 2),
    global_window_size=(8, 4, 2, 1),
    local_window_size=7,
    attn_dropout=0.1,
    ff_dropout=0.1
).to(device)

criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss(weight=class_weights_tensor)
```

For training the `PyTorch` framework was used. This model was optimize to consume as less resources as possible while delivering dissent inference CPU performance.

Model was published on Hugging Face: artursultanov/cosmoformer-model.
